An increasingly common way for policymakers and practitioners to draw insight is coming from the insights of former extremists. These insights provide a peak into the contours of violent extremism and terrorism. Some researchers are concerned for this increasing way for information, while others argue that former extremist can provide valuable insight into many concerns on terrorism. Researchers are addressing key questions in terrorism and extreme studies like radicalization and disengagement. 
Researchers find these political extremists online. They are trying to bring the extremist to the table to ask questions but are struggling to do so. The researchers decide to understand the “interplay” between the internet and violent extremism. The researchers are conducting interviews with right-wing extremists and their use of the internet and connections between their online world and offline world. 
In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 former extremists who were involved in violent skinhead groups. They, at once in their life, used violence in the name of an extreme ideology and associated a violent movement.
These extremists have given up on their old ways and now claim to be over their past beliefs. They identify themselves as being “off the grid”. They are not on social media or public events, meaning they are no longer using technology to advocate for political extremism. Although they are no longer extremist, for now, they are not using the internet to do anything they say.
