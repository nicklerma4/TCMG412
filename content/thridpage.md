As political tension continues to rise and as people take their angst online, it's important to know
how this kind of radicalization takes place online. When people are generally introduced to
radical content online it's important to know when people decide to take actions themselves and
become ‘activists’.
 I believe the internet has played a huge role in categorizing people and initially giving
them the ability to immerse themselves in extreme content and networks of people that have the
same belief, which creates a mindset that ‘everyone’ thinks like this.
It’s also important to note that most online actions are initially started by offline
interactions, most people are initially drawn to radical ideas when they have a desire to ‘belong
to something’ as a study by VOXpol shows. The internet can serve as a gateway for individuals
to engage in extremist activities offline, connecting adherents in the online community to the
offline world. The internet helps create a mask that encourages people to be more toxic than they
would in a normal social setting, people tend to feel like there are no repercussions due to an
increased sense of anonymity and privacy on the internet.
People that are involved in extremist action such as far-right activists are generally
known to recruit potential candidates through face to face relationships, sharing their ideology
and reaffirming their extremist beliefs. While the internet plays a secondary role in radicalizing
U.S. extremists to act violently.
The internet has brought about so many changes to our society, some for the better others
for worse. It’s our responsibility as a society to know how the internet help promote violent
actions against others.
